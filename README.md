# SingleBitResNets

This site was created for a submission to ICLR 2018.

The submission was accepted (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rytNfI1AZ). This was a temporary page used only during double-blind peer review.

The paper title is "Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight"

Author: Mark D. McDonnell (https://cls-lab.org)

A link to an arxiv version of the paper will appear shortly at the above link.

Information originally provided here for the purposes of peer review.

"We provide here code written in Matlab and using the matconvnet package (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) that will enable the reader to verify our strong error rate results using a single-bit for each weight in inference.

The test error rate for CIFAR-100 for this 20-4 plain all-convolutional network with 4.5 million single-bit weights is 24.5%. Our 1-bit result for a ResNet shown in Table 1 in our submitted paper is 24.06%. 

We chose to provide code for the plain network as our example, for the extra simplicity.
