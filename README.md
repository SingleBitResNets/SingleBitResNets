# SingleBitResNets

We provide here code written in Matlab and using the matconvnet package (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) that will enable the reader to verify our strong error rate results using a single-bit for each weight in inference.

The test error rate for CIFAR-100 for this Ã—4 plain all-convolutional network is 24.5%. Our 1-bit result for a ResNet shown in Table 1 is 24.06%. 

We chose to provide code for the plain network as our example, for the extra simplicity.
